to start the project run

cd /server npm start
cd /client npm start

If you've made it this far (After you have seen the previous exercise) I hope you continue to enjoy!

Here is an application for uploading photos.
The application saves the images according to the time you set.

Some things you should know:

1. The db is local and the images are deleted by interval (I thought and wrote several different ways to delete and finally chose this simple way. I'm ready to protect everything!)

2. The image you upload will be displayed on the screen behind after requesting it again from the server. (And if you recognize a familiar picture, you're not wrong..)

3. Hanetz from the tests that cause difficult problems (mainly around the configuration of a node) everything meets the requirements (I hope..)

Enjoy!
